NativeQR
========

NativeQR adds the ability to read QR codes directly in iOS 6's Camera.app. It also allows you to share contacts via QR code. I've decided to open-source it so that it may teach someone how *not* to make a tweak.

The source was the second tweak I ever made, the first being Beacon. I had little understanding of memory management, and just development in general, as I had come from years of Java and VB.NET. This code is terribly messy and awful. It hurts my eyes to look at. I've come a long way since then.

You'll most likely have a very difficult time building this. But, maybe it will help guide someone into creating a QR code tweak for newer versions of iOS. That being said, keep in mind nobody really uses QR codes anymore. (nobody ever did, honestly)
